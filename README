== About the Script ==

The Location Bookmarking Script (LOC) makes it easy 
to bookmark folders and to move across bookmarked folders.


== Syntax ==

$ . loc rem [Location_NickName]
$ . loc go [Location_NickName]
$ . loc show
$ . loc clear [all|number]

Notice the DOT (.) before every command.
Technically it is only required with the "go" command,
But if you use it with all the "loc" it just makes it that bit
easier for your brain!! :)


=== Commands ===

rem - Remember the current working directory.
    Optionally you may specify a short nick name
    Example: (/etc/mail)$ . loc rem mail
             (/home/xk0der)$.  loc rem
    The first command will save /etc/mail as mail
    Second will store /home/xk0der as default location

go  - Go will move you to the locations you saved using 'rem'
    Example: $ . loc go mail
             $ . loc go
    Taking previours examples into consideration the first
    will take you to /etc/mail, the second wil take you to /home/xk0der

show  - This will list down a numbered list of remembered (saved) locations
      Example: $ . loc show
      Output format is
          indexNumber [nickName]: storedLocation
      Example output:
          1 [default]: /usr/src" 
          2 [mail]: /etc/mail
          3 [share]: /usr/local/share

clear - Clears saved locations
      You need to either specify 'all' after this command to clear
      all saved locations or a number as shown by 'show' command 
      to delete that location
      Example: $ . loc clear all
               $ . loc clear 2
